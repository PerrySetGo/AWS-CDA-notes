## IAM 101

* Granting users and providing access to the user console.
* Manage users
* centralized control over AWS account
* Shared access and granular permissions to AWS
* Identity Federation (logging in including via Active Directory, Facebook etc)
* Multifactor authentication
* Provides temporary access for users/devices, for example to a S3 bucket
* allows you to set up your own password rotation policy
* Integrates with many different AWS services
* Supports PCI DSS Compliance (related to payment card industry)

## Critical Terms

* users: end users
* groups: collection of users grouped together under one set of permissions
* roles: you create roles and can then assign them to AWS resources (EX: ECc2 instance, if you wanted that to access S3 you could do that using a role)
* policy: document that defines one or more permissions, can be attached to user, group or role, which then gets the permissions outlined in the policy doc.

## IAM lab
* Services get launched to US East N Virginia first generally
* MFA: MultiFactor authentication
* Best idea to create relevant groups and then apply a policy
* Need to use a MFA device such as google authenticator in order to authenticate thru Multifactor
* Users can have Programmatic (key/secret, thru SDK, CLI, etc) or Console access
* Policies are written in JSON k/v pairs
* Programmatic access uses key/secret, console access uses username and pw combination
* can selectively attach policies to users to extend policies given by groups
* Roles: secure ways to grant permissions to entities that you trust: IAM user in a different account, app code in another EC2 instance, an aws service that needs to act on resources
* identity federation with SAML

## IAM Summary
* IAM consists of users, groups, roles, policy docs
* IAM is universal, does not apply to regions (it is universal)
